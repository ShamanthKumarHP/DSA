DP-MCM-Squares

dp = [ [0] * cols] * rows # not good for 2d dp. Only 1 d is good. copy by reference it is
use below
dp2 =  [[0 for j in range(cols)] for i in range(rows)]
for i in range(rows):
    dp[i][0] = matrix[i][0]
    dp2[i][0] = matrix[i][0]



strings
note for string[1:-1:-1] does not work, as it represent last index - middle value
dont fetch value of first element like this


better to pass variables rather than keeping it as class variables
